        <p>Dear Parents, Students and well-wishers, thousands of students drain out from Nepal in search of quality education to India and other countries every year. There are Nepalese who have the capacity to run high quality educational institution in Nepal itself. Lumbini ICT Campus paves international quality education at an affordable cost. Proper development of both head and heart leads an individual towards sustainable fast growth in career and life. For that, every student needs an environment conducive to self-learning with team work, nurturing and guidance by experienced mentors and lecturers. Recognizing this fact, we have designed and launched many innovative activity oriented student-centered talent development programs for our students to ensure their wholehearted involvement. In fact, many of our activities and events are initiated and managed by the students themselves. This enriches the students’ team work abilities and project management skill that are crucial for success in their career. At Lumbini ICT Campus, students get an opportunity to learn and respond to newer challenges, identify and seize opportunities and discover their own talent through trust and partnership in learning. Let’s grow together. Thank You!</p>
